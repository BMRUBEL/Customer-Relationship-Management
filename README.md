# Customer-Relationship-Management
I have made Customer Relationship Management software. The most commonly used languages are raw PHP and javaScript.
My project aims to develop a comprehensive and efficient Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that will help
business effectively manage and enhance their relationships with customers. The CRM system will provide a centralized platform
 to store customer data, track interactions, and streamline various aspects of customer engagement, such as sales, marketing, and customer suppor. Key features of my CRM software are contact Management, Sales and Lead Management, Marketing Authomation, customer Support, Reporting, and Analytics.
